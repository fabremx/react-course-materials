# Why Facebook created hooks

## Hooks what it is ?

Appear in React 16.8.0.
Hooks are functions that allow you to « plug in » to React’s local state and lifecycle management from component functions.

It’s a new way to develop component, but

- Class are not depreciated
- Hooks do not change React concepts

## Why Facebook created Hooks

1. React does not offer any way to « attach » reusable behavior to a component (Cf [HoC](https://github.com/fabremx/react-course-materials/tree/master/patterns/HoC)).
2. Complex component become difficult to understand (Cf [Class Component Limitation](https://github.com/fabremx/react-course-materials/tree/master/classComponents/limitations)).
3. Class are confusing for people and machine alike (Cf ["This" Error](https://github.com/fabremx/react-course-materials/tree/tree/master/classComponents/thisError)).
