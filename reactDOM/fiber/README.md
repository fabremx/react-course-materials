# Fiber & Reconciliation calcul

**Reconciliation** is a comparaison algorithm which determins which changed since the last update.

Thanks to the reconciliation mechanism & Virtual DOM :
React applies only the DOM updates necessary to reflect the indented state.

**Fiber** is the reconcialition engine since React 16.
Its main purpose is to enable incremental rendering of the virtual DOM
